          The United States' Pioneer 4 spacecraft aims to fly by and photograph the Moon. The Second Stage rockets fail to cut off on time, and the spacecraft passes by the moon too far away from the imaging scanner to function. However, Pioneer 4 becomes the first American craft to leave Earth orbit, and scientists collect useful data on radiation in space.
